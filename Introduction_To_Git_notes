Why a uniformed system (why choose git or svn)

I continue to look for opportunities for the team to be able to better collaborate.

Why Git
  - popular
    - Microsoft is using it for it's open-source 
  - distributed
    - no one head that can be compromised. 

  - collaboration
    - code sharing
    - code review (redundency)
    - issue tracking
    - ad hoc sharing / collaboration
    - work studies
    - other units/departments
- using a process will free us to not have to think about that stuff.
